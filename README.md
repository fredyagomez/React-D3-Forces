# React-D3-Forces

This is an adaptation of the classical d3-force demo in canvas created by Mike Bostock (https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1b64ec067fcfc51e7471d944f51f1611)

This application implements latest D3 version (V4) in React. The DOM is controlled through refs and instead of 
canvas, here we are using svg.
